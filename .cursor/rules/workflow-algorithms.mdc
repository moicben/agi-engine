Key workflow components:

### Core Orchestration
- Device Discovery & Activation
- Parallel Account Creation
- WhatsApp Setup & Verification 
- Session Management & Transfer
- Message Sending Coordination

The workflows are structured in layers:

1. Device Layer (`services/device-service.js`, Score: 80)
- Manages device lifecycle across environments (MoreLogin, BlueStacks, cloud)
- Handles device creation, launching and discovery
- Maps device identifiers to addresses

2. Session Layer (`services/session-service.js`, Score: 75) 
- Extracts/imports WhatsApp sessions between devices
- Manages session data persistence and transfer
- Handles session verification states

3. Messaging Layer (`services/sender-service.js`, Score: 85)
- Manages WhatsApp message sending workflows
- Handles number formatting and validation
- Controls rate limiting and parallel sends
- Manages media attachments

4. Branding Layer (`workflows/whatsapp/brand.js`, Score: 80)
- Sets up WhatsApp business profiles
- Manages profile images and descriptions
- Handles verification status

5. Orchestration Layer (`orchestrator.js`, Score: 90)
- Coordinates all workflow components
- Manages parallel execution
- Handles retry logic and error states
- Controls rate limiting

The workflows are executed through runners:

- `runners/brander.js` (Score: 70) - Executes branding workflows
- `runners/linker.js` (Score: 60) - Manages device linking
- `runners/sender.js` (Score: 60) - Controls message sending
- `runners/universaler.js` (Score: 70) - Handles universal workflows

Key Patterns:
- Staggered parallel execution 
- Session state management
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Error handling and recovery

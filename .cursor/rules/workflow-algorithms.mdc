description: For analyzing workflow algorithms and automation patterns in WhatsApp account management and messaging systems
Core WhatsApp Account Management Workflows:
1. Account Creation Pipeline
- Multi-stage verification with SMS activation
- Country-specific phone number acquisition
- Rate-limited account creation (3 attempts per proxy)
- Automated device linking between virtual/physical phones
- Status tracking: pending -> verified -> branded -> active
2. Parallel Processing Architecture
- Orchestrated instance management (8-12 concurrent accounts)
- Master-slave device coordination for brand transfer
- Queue-based message distribution with rate limiting
- Device state synchronization with health monitoring
3. Brand Transfer Workflow
- Sequential brand profile application
- Master device coordination for profile verification
- Automated QR code scanning for device linking
- Profile image and status synchronization
4. Campaign Management
- Contact batch processing with status tracking
- Rate-limited message sending (15-20/hour)
- Contact state management (pending/sent/failed)
- Automated retry logic for failed messages

Core WhatsApp Account Workflow:

1. Account Creation Pipeline
- Phone number validation and formatting for target regions (FR, UK, CA) 
- Progressive multi-stage verification:
  * Initial SMS code request
  * Code validation (OCR extraction)
  * Account confirmation
  * Transfer code handling
- Intelligent retry with exponential backoff on failures
- VPN rotation between attempts

2. Branding Automation
- Systematic profile setup sequence:
  * Name/description insertion
  * Profile image upload
  * Business category selection
  * About text configuration
- Multi-step navigation through settings
- Screenshot validation at key steps
- OCR-based success verification

3. Device Management
- Coordinated device linking workflow:
  * QR code detection and capture
  * Multi-device pairing protocol
  * Session transfer validation
  * Account migration confirmation

4. Message Distribution
- Rate-limited sending with dynamic delays:
  * Initial 5 message burst
  * Progressive slowdown
  * Random intervals (15-45s)
- Contact verification pre-send
- Status tracking:
  * delivered
  * failed
  * blocked
  * not_registered
- Automatic retry queue for failed attempts

5. Parallel Processing
- Device pool management
- Concurrent session handling
- Synchronized state updates
- Resource locking for critical operations

Implementation Paths:
/tools/whatsapp/app-service.js - Account creation workflow
/tools/whatsapp/ocr-service.js - Verification code extraction
/tools/whatsapp/sender-service.js - Message distribution
/flows/whatsapp/brand.js - Profile setup automation

Importance Scores:
Account Creation: 95/100
Branding Automation: 85/100
Device Management: 80/100
Message Distribution: 90/100
Parallel Processing: 75/100

description: Configuration policy — centralize engine preferences in core/config.js; keep secrets only in .env
---

# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
description: Mandatory configuration governance rule. All engine usage preferences and personalization parameters must be stored in `core/config.js`. Only API keys and authentication credentials belong in `.env`.

Policy:
- Store all non-secret configuration (defaults, preferences, product/engine personalization, feature toggles, timeouts, limits, model names, rates, weights) in `core/config.js` under clear domains.
- Do NOT place preferences, toggles, or any non-secret values in `.env`.
- `.env` is strictly for secrets and credentials: API keys, tokens, passwords, private IDs, and authentication material only.
- Code outside `core/config.js` must not access `process.env` directly. Always import `config` from `core/config.js`.

Scope:
- Applies to `core/engine/*`, `workers/*`, `tools/*`, `pages/api/*`, and any runtime code.
- `core/config.js` is the single source of truth for runtime configuration.

Implementation Guidance:
- Organize by domain inside `config` (e.g., `config.engine`, `config.llm`, `config.memory`, `config.vpn`, domain-specific groups).
- Provide explicit defaults in `core/config.js`. If environment-specific variants are needed, implement them inside `core/config.js` (e.g., keyed by `NODE_ENV`), not via scattered `.env` reads.
- Secrets from `.env` (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) may be read only within `core/config.js` and then exposed as needed through the `config` object.

Examples — Where values must live:
- `config.llm`: model name, provider selection, non-secret tuning; `.env`: `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `config.engine`: iterations, backoff, critic sample rate, retries, timeouts.
- `config.memory`: max rows, topK, weights, budgets.
- `config.vpn`: region/country preference (non-secret); `.env`: VPN credentials if any.
- Domain toggles (payments/identity/whatsapp): enable/disable features, rate limits, thresholds → in `config`.

Secrets allowed in `.env` (illustrative):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `BRICKS_API_KEY`, `WESTERN_UNION_USERNAME/PASSWORD`, OAuth tokens, JWT secrets.

Enforcement Checklist (for PRs/Reviews):
- No new direct `process.env` usage outside `core/config.js`.
- New non-secret settings added under `core/config.js` with sensible defaults and typed/validated where applicable.
- Secrets referenced only through `core/config.js` and sourced from `.env`.

# configuration

Acceptance & Evolution:
- Prefer minimal, centralized configuration with clear defaults. If the configuration shape evolves, update `core/config.js` and this rule together.

# service-integration

The service integration layer handles interactions between WhatsApp, SMS activation, device management, and database services through several key components:

### Core Service Integrations

#### WhatsApp Service (Importance: 90)
- Manages WhatsApp account lifecycle including setup, verification, and messaging
- Implements retry mechanisms for failed operations with exponential backoff 
- Handles session management between devices through export/import workflows
- Coordinates with SMS service for verification codes

#### Device Management Service (Importance: 85)
- Controls device pools across cloud, BlueStacks and MoreLogin environments
- Manages device allocation, startup and shutdown
- Implements device health checks and automatic recovery
- Coordinates proxy assignments for devices

#### SMS Activation Service (Importance: 80)
- Interfaces with SMS-Activate API for phone number provisioning
- Implements timeouts and retries for SMS code reception
- Manages activation state transitions and error recovery
- Coordinates with WhatsApp service for verification flow

### Integration Workflows

#### Account Setup Workflow (Importance: 85)
- Orchestrates device allocation, SMS activation, and WhatsApp setup
- Implements parallel account creation with configurable concurrency
- Handles cleanup and resource release on failures

#### Message Sending Workflow (Importance: 80)  
- Coordinates message delivery across multiple WhatsApp instances
- Implements rate limiting and random delays
- Handles failed message retries and status tracking

#### Device Transfer Workflow (Importance: 75)
- Manages WhatsApp session migration between devices
- Coordinates device state transitions during transfer
- Implements rollback on failed transfers

The service integration layer uses a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for handling transient failures, tracks operation status in the database, and implements proper cleanup of resources on failures.

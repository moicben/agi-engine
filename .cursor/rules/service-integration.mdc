# service-integration

Service Layer Integration Architecture:

1. WhatsApp Service Integration
- Bidirectional communication between WhatsApp API and device management layer 
- Status propagation through event bus for device/account state changes
- Retry mechanism for failed WhatsApp operations with exponential backoff
- Cross-service session management for multi-device WhatsApp instances
File Path: services/whatsapp/app-service.js
Importance Score: 85

2. SMS Verification Integration 
- SMS gateway abstraction supporting multiple providers
- Country-specific number acquisition with price-based routing
- Verification code extraction and validation pipeline
- Service health monitoring with fallback provider switching
File Path: services/sms-service.js
Importance Score: 80

3. Device Management Integration
- Centralized device pool management for virtual/physical devices
- Device state synchronization across WhatsApp/SMS services
- Automated device cleanup and session recycling
- Resource locking for concurrent service access
File Path: services/device-service.js 
Importance Score: 75

4. Data Persistence Layer
- Event sourcing pattern for cross-service state management
- Transaction coordination across WhatsApp/SMS operations
- Retry queues for failed operations with deadletter handling
- Service-specific data partitioning and cleanup policies
File Path: services/database-service.js
Importance Score: 70

Key Integration Patterns:
- Event-driven communication between services
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
- Idempotent operations with deduplication
- Distributed locking for shared resources

Error Handling:
- Service-specific retry policies
- Graceful degradation with fallback services
- Cross-service transaction rollback
- Dead letter queues for failed operations

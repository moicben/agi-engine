description: Technical specification for service integration patterns across WhatsApp, SMS, device management and data persistence layers
Service Layer Integration Architecture:
- Bidirectional communication between WhatsApp API and device management layer 
- Status propagation through event bus for device/account state changes
- Retry mechanism for failed WhatsApp operations with exponential backoff
- Cross-service session management for multi-device WhatsApp instances
File Path: services/whatsapp/app-service.js
Importance Score: 85
2. SMS Verification Integration 
- SMS gateway abstraction supporting multiple providers
- Country-specific number acquisition with price-based routing
- Verification code extraction and validation pipeline
- Service health monitoring with fallback provider switching
File Path: services/sms-service.js
Importance Score: 80
3. Device Management Integration
- Centralized device pool management for virtual/physical devices
- Device state synchronization across WhatsApp/SMS services
- Automated device cleanup and session recycling
- Resource locking for concurrent service access
File Path: services/device-service.js 
Importance Score: 75
4. Data Persistence Layer
- Event sourcing pattern for cross-service state management
- Transaction coordination across WhatsApp/SMS operations
- Retry queues for failed operations with deadletter handling
- Service-specific data partitioning and cleanup policies
File Path: services/database-service.js
Importance Score: 70
Key Integration Patterns:
- Event-driven communication between services
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
- Idempotent operations with deduplication
- Distributed locking for shared resources
- Service-specific retry policies
- Graceful degradation with fallback services
- Cross-service transaction rollback
- Dead letter queues for failed operations

Service Layer Architecture:

1. WhatsApp Account Services
- Account creation and verification flow orchestration
- Multi-stage registration with SMS verification
- Profile setup automation with branding logic
- Session persistence across device transfers
- Custom retry mechanisms for failed verifications
Importance Score: 85/100

2. SMS Integration Service 
- Country-specific phone number acquisition
- Verification code extraction and validation
- SMS activation lifecycle management 
- Multi-provider fallback system
Importance Score: 75/100

3. Device Management Service
- Cross-platform device orchestration (MoreLogin, BlueStacks)
- Device discovery through port scanning
- Environment-specific connection handling
- Automated device linking with QR code management
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Database Integration Layer
- Status tracking for device/account associations
- Campaign progress persistence
- Contact verification state management
- Message delivery tracking
Importance Score: 70/100

Core Integration Workflows:

1. Account Creation Pipeline:
WhatsApp Service -> SMS Service -> Device Service -> Database
- Coordinates device provisioning
- Handles SMS verification 
- Manages session persistence
- Tracks verification status

2. Message Distribution Flow:
Database -> WhatsApp Service -> Device Service
- Contact batch processing
- Status updates
- Device session management
- Delivery tracking

3. Device Transfer Workflow:
Device Service -> WhatsApp Service -> Database
- Session extraction
- QR code generation/scanning
- Status synchronization
- Account re-verification

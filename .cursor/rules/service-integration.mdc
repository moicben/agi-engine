## Core Service Integration Workflows

### WhatsApp Service Integration (Importance: 95)
- Implements device-specific WhatsApp interactions through ADB commands
- Manages account creation, verification, and branding processes
- Handles multi-device synchronization and QR code-based device linking
- Files: `services/whatsapp-service.js`, `workflows/universal.js`

### SMS Integration Service (Importance: 90)
- Manages SMS verification code acquisition and validation
- Implements fallback mechanisms for SMS providers with country-specific routing
- Handles activation timeouts and retries for failed SMS deliveries
- Files: `services/sms-service.js`, `workflows/setup.js`

### Device Management Integration (Importance: 85)
- Coordinates device provisioning across multiple platforms (BlueStacks, MoreLogin, cloud)
- Implements proxy management and device state synchronization
- Manages parallel device operations with rate limiting
- Files: `services/device-service.js`, `scripts/createCloudPhone.js`

### Database Integration Layer (Importance: 80)
- Manages contact retrieval and status updates through Supabase
- Implements campaign-specific contact filtering and processing
- Tracks message delivery status and campaign progress
- Files: `utils/supabase.js`, `workflows/send.js`

## Integration Workflows

### Account Setup Workflow (Importance: 85)
- Coordinates SMS verification, WhatsApp setup, and device configuration
- Implements retry mechanisms for failed verifications
- Files: `workflows/setup.js`, `workflows/universal.js`

### Message Delivery Workflow (Importance: 80)
- Manages contact retrieval, message sending, and status updates

### Device Linking Workflow (Importance: 75)
- Coordinates QR code generation and scanning between devices
- Manages multi-device synchronization states
- Files: `workflows/link-device.js`

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Service Recovery Mechanisms (Importance: 85)
- Implements exponential backoff for service retries
- Manages service timeouts and fallback strategies
- Files: `utils/helpers.js`

### Integration State Management (Importance: 80)
- Tracks service integration states across workflows
- Manages recovery from partial workflow completion
- Files: `workflows/universal.js`, `parallel-runner.js`

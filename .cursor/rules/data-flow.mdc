# data-flow

Key Data Flow Pipelines:

1. Identity Document Processing
- Input: Raw document images/scans (ID cards, passports)
- OCR extraction via Mindee API for French documents
- GPT-4 Vision analysis for passport data
- Standardization and field normalization
- Database storage in Supabase
- Status tracking (new -> pending -> verified/rejected)

2. SMS Verification Flow
- Phone number acquisition from provider pool
- Country-specific number formatting
- OTP message interception
- Verification code extraction via OCR
- Status updates through verification lifecycle
- Temporary email verification fallback

3. Payment Processing Pipeline
- Card details capture and validation
- 3D-Secure verification flow
- Status propagation through verification stages
- Transaction confirmation tracking
- Fee calculation and deduction logic
- Payment provider integration (MangoPay, Western Union)

4. Message Handling System
- Contact data normalization and validation
- Campaign-based message templating
- Delivery status tracking
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Multi-device message synchronization
- Session state management

Key Integration Points:
- Identity verification services (Mindee, GPT-4)
- Payment processors (MangoPay, Western Union)
- SMS/Email verification providers
- WhatsApp multi-device messaging
- Supabase database storage

Critical Data States:
- Document verification: new -> pending -> verified/rejected
- Payment processing: initiated -> pending -> success/declined
- Message delivery: queued -> sent -> delivered/failed
- Account verification: new -> processing -> verified/blocked

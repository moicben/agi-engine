description: Analyze data flow patterns in identity verification, document processing, messaging, payment, and engine orchestration systems
# data-flow
Key Data Flow Pipelines:
Note: Names/states are illustrative. Prefer current code and run artifacts when they differ.
1. Identity Document Processing
- Input: Raw document images/scans (ID cards, passports)
- Mindee OCR for French documents; GPT-4o vision for passports
- MRZ parse and validation; standardization and field normalization
- Confidence scoring; Supabase persistence
- Status tracking (new -> pending -> verified/rejected)
2. Engine Orchestration Run Flow
- Think/Analyze/Plan JSON → Assign (capabilities) → Execute (worker envelope)
- Persist under `core/runs/<run-id>/iteration-XXXX/*`
- Ledger/events append with redaction
- Critic verdicts feed Decide; retries/backoff
3. Payment Processing Pipeline
- Card details capture and validation
- 3D-Secure verification flow
- Status propagation (initiated → pending → success/declined/refused/elapsed/error)
- Fee calculation and deduction
- Western Union (init/proceed/topup) integration
4. WhatsApp Message & Account Flows
- Contact normalization → templating → queued send → rate limiting
- Delivery status tracking; multi-device session management
- Account creation and transfer pipelines (OTP/OCR, QR, sessions)

Key Integration Points:
- Identity (Mindee, GPT‑4o) ↔ Payments (KYC) ↔ WhatsApp (account verification)
- Supabase persistence for identities, payments, campaigns
- Engine run persistence/ledger for audit

Critical States:
- Document: new → pending → verified/rejected
- Payment: started/init → processed → success/declined/refused/elapsed/error
- Messaging: queued → sent → delivered/failed/blocked
- Engine run: in_progress → success/failed; task: pending → running → success/failed/skipped

Core Components & Files:
- Identity: tools/identity/extractIdentities.js, tools/identity/extractPassports.js
- Payments: workers/web/bricks/westernunion/{westernInit.js,westernProceed.js,westernTopup.js}, tools/western/*
- WhatsApp: tools/whatsapp/app-service.js, workers/whatsapp/*
- Engine: core/engine/*, core/run.js (ledger/persist at core/engine/persist.js)

Key Transformations:
- OCR → normalized identity JSON with confidence
- Phone normalization; message chunking/personalization
- Payment state progression with artifacts/screenshots
- Engine envelopes → critic verdicts → decisions

Primary Storage:
- Supabase (identities, payments, campaigns)
- `core/runs/*` (context, plan/assign, per-task execute/critic, ledger/events, artifacts)

Validation Checkpoints:
- Identity confidence thresholds by field
- Phone number format and reachability
- Message delivery receipts and rate limits
- Payment result pages/URLs + 3DS OCR
- Engine acceptance criteria per task

# data-flow

The data flow architecture consists of several key pipelines:

### SMS Verification Pipeline
- SMS activation service obtains phone numbers from SMS-Activate API
- Verification codes retrieved through polling with retry logic
- OCR service extracts codes from screenshots
- Results flow to WhatsApp setup workflow
- File: `services/sms-service.js`
- Importance Score: 85

### OCR Processing Pipeline
- Screenshots captured from device
- Tesseract OCR extracts text content
- Text analyzed for phone numbers and status indicators
- Results flow to verification and session management
- File: `services/ocr-service.js` 
- Importance Score: 90

### Session Management Pipeline
- WhatsApp sessions extracted from source devices
- Session data stored temporarily
- Sessions imported to target devices
- Status tracked through database
- File: `services/session-service.js`
- Importance Score: 80

### Message Distribution Pipeline 
- New contacts retrieved from database
- Messages selected randomly from templates
- Sent via WhatsApp with random delays
- Status updates flow back to database
- File: `services/sender-service.js`
- Importance Score: 85

### Device Management Pipeline
- Device discovery across environments
- Device status monitoring and updates
- Screenshots and interaction events
- Results flow to workflow orchestrator
- File: `services/device-service.js`
- Importance Score: 75

### Database Integration Pipeline
- Contact status updates
- Campaign tracking data
- Lead storage with deduplication
- Stats aggregation for reporting
- File: `utils/supabase.js`
- Importance Score: 80

Core workflows coordinate these pipelines:
- Account setup and verification
- Session transfer between devices  
- Automated messaging sequences
- Device linking and synchronization

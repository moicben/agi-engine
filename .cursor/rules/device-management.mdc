## Core Device Management Workflows (Importance: 95)
- Multi-environment device orchestration across BlueStacks, MoreLogin and cloud platforms
- Stateful device tracking using global device map with configurations and status
- Proxy assignment and management for cloud devices with residential proxy prioritization
- Automated device creation and initialization with environment-specific validations
- Device state synchronization across parallel workflows

## Environment-Specific Implementations (Importance: 90)
- BlueStacks: Direct ADB command execution and screenshot capture
- MoreLogin: Simulated commands and local API integration
- Cloud: Remote device provisioning with proxy configuration

## Device Interaction Patterns (Importance: 85)
- Unified ADB interaction layer for device commands
- Interactive mode for real-time device testing and command execution
- Screenshot analysis with OCR for state verification
- Device connection validation and retry mechanisms
- Custom launch hooks for environment-specific startup sequences

## Key Components:

### Device Service (`services/device-service.js`)
- Environment detection and initialization
- Device state management
- Command execution routing
- Screenshot orchestration

### Device Scripts
- `scripts/createCloudPhone.js`: Cloud device provisioning
- `scripts/startPhone.js`: Device initialization workflow
- `scripts/interactive-phone.js`: Interactive testing mode
- `scripts/launchWhatsApp.js`: Application launch automation

### Device Workflows
- `workflows/brand.js`: Multi-device branding orchestration
- `workflows/clear.js`: Device state cleaning
- `workflows/link-device.js`: Device linking automation
- `workflows/setup.js`: Initial device configuration

### Device Runners
- `runners/brander.js`: Branding workflow execution
- `runners/cleaner.js`: Cleaning workflow execution
- `runners/linker.js`: Linking workflow execution
- `runners/setter.js`: Setup workflow execution

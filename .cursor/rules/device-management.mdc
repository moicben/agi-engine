description: Specification for device management implementations and their interactions with WhatsApp/SMS flows
Core Components:
1. Multi-Environment Device Orchestration
- Manage BlueStacks, MoreLogin, and cloud devices with unified API
- State sync between local/cloud instances; startup/shutdown sequences
Importance Score: 85/100
2. ADB Communication & Visual Verification
- Custom ADB patterns, screenshot-driven checks, process-aware ops
Importance Score: 80/100
3. Device Pooling and Locks
- Dynamic allocation; health monitoring; automatic recovery; resource locks
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Workflows:
- Initialization → readiness checks → failure recovery with retries
- State transitions: disconnected → connecting → ready → error/locked
- Command interface + screenshot verification + error recovery
Files:
- tools/others/device-service.js (primary abstraction)
- workers/whatsapp/* (consumers), tools/whatsapp/* (OCR/flows)

# device-management

Operational Guidance:
- Use locks to prevent concurrent device access
- Always verify visual state before irreversible actions
- Persist session artifacts when linking devices (QR, cookies)
- Recover on failures with bounded retries and backoff; rotate VPN/proxy as needed

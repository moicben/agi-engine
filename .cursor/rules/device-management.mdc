### Core Device Management Services

The device management implementation centers around handling different device environments and ADB interactions:

#### Device Service (`services/device-service.js`)
- **Importance Score: 95**
- Creates and launches devices across BlueStacks, MoreLogin and cloud environments 
- Discovers BlueStacks instances by port scanning and connection attempts
- Maps device identifiers to valid addresses based on environment
- Manages device startup sequences and connection verification

#### ADB Interface (`utils/adb.js`)
- **Importance Score: 85**
- Handles ADB command execution and device interactions
- Manages screenshots, input simulation, app installation and device info retrieval
- Controls device state transitions and verifies connectivity

### Device Workflows

#### Device Creation (`scripts/createCloudPhone.js`)
- **Importance Score: 80**
- Provisions new cloud devices with proxy configuration
- Handles device naming and initial setup
- Validates device readiness and connectivity

#### Device Startup (`scripts/startPhone.js`)
- **Importance Score: 75**
- Manages device boot sequence and ADB activation
- Implements retry logic for failed device starts
- Handles timeout scenarios and state verification

### Device State Management

#### Session Management (`services/session-service.js`)
- **Importance Score: 70**
- Extracts and imports device sessions
- Maintains session continuity across device restarts
- Handles session data persistence and recovery

#### State Transitions
- Device state tracking across boot, ready, and error states
- Recovery procedures for failed state transitions
- Environment-specific state management rules

### Key Integration Points

#### VPN Management (`services/vpnios-service.js`)
- **Importance Score: 65**
- Controls VPN configurations per device
- Manages VPN server selection and connection states
- Handles VPN authentication and session persistence

#### Orchestration (`orchestrator.js`)
- **Importance Score: 85**
- Coordinates device creation, startup and teardown
- Manages parallel device operations
- Handles environment-specific device coordination
